# Neural Labs

A neural network education project written in Rust. 

## Matrix module
Matrix module is prettly simple and designed to perform the basic operations with matrices such as
- element-wise add, subtract, multiplicate, divide
- matrix product
- transposing
- calculate the mean value, etc


## Neural Networks module
The neural network module is under construction now.

_Currently the feedforward network is in development_
